Error executing rule MergeVCFs on cluster (jobid: 7, external: Submitted batch job 22866602, jobscript: /storage/hpc/group/bilyeu/nad7wf/allele_atlas_pipeline/.snakemake/tmp.4r6i2ofn/snakejob.MergeVCFs.7.sh). For error details see the cluster log and the log files of the involved rule(s).
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
